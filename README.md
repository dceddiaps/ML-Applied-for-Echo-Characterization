# Machine Learning Modeling Applied for Seabed Echo-Characterization in King George Bay, Antarctica.

The main goal of this code is to extrapolate, using XGBoost, the echo-classification of seismic lines into a bigger area. The surface created is a result of statistic correlations between depth, backscatter, seafloor slope and two distance parameters (feature engeneering), which tryied to represent geological influence factors in echo-types definition.

The whole study encompass data conditioning and model/data explainability, all necessary steps to understand and build a reliable result.

This code, for me, is an interesting approach that could be (and maybe will!!) implemented in a seismic interpretation software: the possibility to correlate seismic classes with other spatial data, represented as overlaid grids.
